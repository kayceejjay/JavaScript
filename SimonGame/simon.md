Step 1 - Add Javascript and jQuery

Our game logic will be created inside an external Javascript file.

1. Create a new file called game.js

2. Link to this new external JS file from your index.html

3. Add an alert to game.js and test that the alert gets triggered when you load up index.html in Chrome.

Once, you've confirmed that game.js is correctly linked, you can delete or comment out the alert.
