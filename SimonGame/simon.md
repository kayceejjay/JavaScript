##Step 1 - Add JavaScript and jQuery

  Our game logic will be created inside an external JavaScript file.

1.  Create a new file called game.js

2.  Link to this new external JS file from your index.html

3.  Add an alert to game.js and test that the alert gets triggered when you load up index.html in Chrome.

    Once, you've confirmed that game.js is correctly linked, you can delete or comment out the alert.

4.  Add jQuery to your website and test that it's successfully loaded by opening Chrome developer tools and typing $("h1")

<!--========================================================================================================-->

##Step 2 - Create A New Pattern

1.  Inside game.js create a new function called nextSequence()

2.  Inside the new function generate a new random number between 0 and 3, and store it in a variable called randomNumber

    You can use the Chrome console to verify that your code creates random numbers between the correct range.

3.  At the top of the game.js file, create a new array called buttonColors and set it to hold the sequence "red", "blue", "green", "yellow" .

4.  Create a new variable called randomChosenColor and use the randomNumber from step 2 to select a random color from the buttonColors array.

5.  At the top of the game.js file, create a new empty array called gamePattern.

6.  Add the new randomChosenColor generated in step 4 to the end of the gamePattern.

##Hints
Hint 1. Remember this is how you create and call functions in JavaScript:

Hint 2A. Remember this is how you generate random numbers between 0 and 0.9999...

Hint 2B. Remember this is how you round down a number.

Hint 3. Remember this is how arrays are created in JavaScript:

Hint 4. Remember this is how you select items inside arrays:

Hint 6. Remember this is how you add new items to arrays:

<!--========================================================================================================-->

##Step 3 - Show the Sequence to the User with Animations and Sounds

1. Use jQuery to select the button with the same id as the randomChosenColour

2. Use Google/Stackoverflow to figure out how you can use jQuery to animate a flash to the button selected in step 1.

You should end up with an effect like this:

3. Use Google/Stackoverflow to figure out how you can use JavaScript to play the sound for the button color selected in step 1.

##Hints
Hint 1. Remember that to select ids with jQuery you need the "#" symbol.

Hint 3. https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=play+sound+javascript

<!--========================================================================================================-->


##Step 4 - Check Which Button is Pressed

1. Use jQuery to detect when any of the buttons are clicked and trigger a handler function.

2. Inside the handler, create a new variable called userChosenColour to store the id of the button that got clicked.

--> So if the Green button was clicked, userChosenColour will equal its id which is "green".

3. At the top of the game.js file, create a new empty array with the name userClickedPattern.

4. Add the contents of the variable userChosenColour created in step 2 to the end of this new userClickedPattern

At this stage, if you log the userClickedPattern you should be able to build up an array in the console by clicking on different buttons.

Note: If you need any hints, try scrolling down. ðŸ‘‡

##Hints
Hint 1A. Remember that all the buttons share the same class (btn).

Hint 1B. Remember that jQuery has a .click() function: https://api.jquery.com/click/

Hint 1C. jQuery handlers are anonymous functions: https://api.jquery.com/click/#click-handler

Hint 2A. Inside the handler, you can use the keyword this to refer to the button object that triggered the click.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this

Hint 2B. You can use the attr() function in jQuery to find out the value of any of the attributes of an object. https://api.jquery.com/attr


<!--========================================================================================================-->

##Step 5 - Add Sounds to Button Clicks

1. In the same way we played sound in nextSequence() , when a user clicks on a button, the corresponding sound should be played. e.g if the Green button is clicked, then green.mp3 should be played.

2. Create a new function called playSound() that takes a single input parameter called name.

3. Take the code we used to play sound in the nextSequence() function and move it to playSound().

4. Refactor the code in playSound() so that it will work for both playing sound in nextSequence() and when the user clicks a button.



##Step 6 - Add Animations to User Clicks

1. Create a new function called animatePress(), it should take a single input parameter called currentColour.

2. Take a look inside the styles.css file, you can see there is a class called "pressed", it will add a box shadow and changes the background colour to grey.

3. Use jQuery to add this pressed class to the button that gets clicked inside animatePress().

4. use Google/Stackoverflow to figure out how you can use Javascript to remove the pressed class after a 100 milliseconds.

Once complete, you will get this effect when you click on any button.

##Step 7 - Start the Game

1. Use jQuery to detect when a keyboard key has been pressed, when that happens for the first time, call nextSequence().

You'll need a way to keep track of whether if the game has started or not, so you only call nextSequence() on the first keypress.

2. Create a new variable called level and start at level 0.

3. The h1 title starts out saying "Press A Key to Start", when the game has started, change this to say "Level 0".

4. Inside nextSequence(), increase the level by 1 every time nextSequence() is called.

5. Inside nextSequence(), update the h1 with this change in the value of level.

All going well, this is what you should see when you refresh the website:

##Hints

Hint 1. You'll need a variable called started to toggle to true once the game starts and if it's true, then further key presses should not trigger nextSequence().

Hint 3. The h1 has a unique id of level-title which you can target with jQuery.

Hint 5.  You'll need to use jQuery again to change the h1 by targeting the id: level-title.
